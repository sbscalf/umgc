### Summary
This program takes data about processes, resources, and their allocations to calculate all possible safe sequences of processes by expanding upon the Banker's Algorithm.  The program is limited from a 1 process-1 resource application to a 9 process-9 resource application.  The program will not accept any smaller or larger input.  For example input, please see any of the txt files in the src directory.

### Notice
The binary file was compiled on a Linux system on an AMD Ryzen 9 CPU.

### Description of files
The txt files are the input files I created for use in the program.  I wanted to test different sizes, but mainly the 3x3 was first used for testing as it was smaller and easier to manage.  5x4.txt was used to further test the program.  Finally, discussion.txt is a 7x5 application of the program.
