/**
 * Contains all of the classes for the ShapesGUI program (CMSC335 Project 2).
 * <p> The classes in the package all support the functionality of Project 2.
 * Most, if not all, of these classes are used in the creation of a
 * well-designed, functioning graphical user interface. This program uses
 * similar classes to those in {@link scalf.project1}, but some of the key
 * functionality needed to be altered.
 * <p>The main class for the ShapesGUI is {@link scalf.ShapesGUI}.
