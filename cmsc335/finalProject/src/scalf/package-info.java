/**
 * Contains the main program files created by Samuel Scalf.
 * <p> The primary purpose of this package was to ensure there were no
 * conflicts with other students' classes that may use the same names. The
 * classes in this package were left at the "root" package level for ease of
 * use.
 * 
 * <h2>Running a Program</h2>
 * <p style="font-size:105%; font-weight: bold;">Compiling</p>
 * To compile a program, you must use the javac tool from the Java Development
 * Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.  In a command line interface or terminal,
 * change the active directory to the location of the '{@code .java}' files.
 * Next type "{@code javac Program.java}", replacing {@code Program.java} with
 * the name of the program, like {@code Shapes.java}.  Each of the classes
 * located directly in this package are the main program files.
 * <p style="text-indent:2.0em">
 * 		<strong>Example:</strong> {@code javac ShapesGUI.java}
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p style="font-size:105%; font-weight: bold;">Running</p>
 * To run a program, after compiling, you just need to type
 * {@code java Program} replacing @{code Program} with the name of the program,
 * assuming the command line interface was not closed. If the command line
 * interface or terminal was closed, open a new one and change the directory to
 * the location of the (@code .java} files, as was done for compiling. Then
 * enter {@code java Program}.
 * <p style="text-indent:2.0em"><strong>
 * 		Example:</strong> {@code java ShapesGUI}
