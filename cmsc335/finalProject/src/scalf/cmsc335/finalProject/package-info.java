/**
 * Contains all of the classes for the TrafficSimulation program (CMSC335 Final
 * Project).
 * <p> The classes in within this package and sub-packages all support the
 * functionality of the project. The classes and interfaces in this package were
 * used in the creation of a multi-threaded GUI application.
 * <p> The interfaces in this package are used to reduce dependency between
 * classes.  It's not an ideal implementation, but I wanted to get used to the
 * idea of abstracting classes.
 * <p>The main class for the program is {@link scalf.TrafficSimulation}.
